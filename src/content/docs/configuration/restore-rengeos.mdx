title: Restore RengeOS (Recovery Mode)
---

- **Essentially**, the ``ros-reborn`` tool allows users to reset their system to its original state
 (as when it was first installed) without having to reinstall using a **Live ISO with a USB drive** as is the usual method.

- **So** we will use ``ros-reborn`` (TUI) to automate the RengeOS restore process to its original state using the ``unsquashfs`` method
and some other related techniques during the process.

## Boot into Recovery Mode
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
  **Be careful** when using ``ros-reborn`` because it will erase the entire ``/`` and ``/boot``
  partitions to install the new version (the ``Recovery Mode`` partition will not be affected).
</Aside>

<Aside type="note">
  **Make sure** you have enabled ``Recovery Mode`` during **installation**, and that ``Recovery Mode`` appears in the ``GRUB`` menu.
</Aside>

- **After** booting up your device, at the bottom of the GRUB menu you will see an option called ``Recovery Mode``.
  **Select it** and **boot** into it before proceeding with ``ros-reborn``.

## Start the process

<Aside type="note">
  ``Recovery Mode`` always only has one **root account** and there are **no other user accounts**.
</Aside>

- **After** booting into ``Recovery Mode`` from the ``GRUB`` menu option, we will log in as **root** using the password you set for **root** during the **previous RengeOS installation**.

![2](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/2.png)

- **Next**, we will proceed with the **factory reset** process using ``ros-reborn``.

```sh
ros-reborn
```

- **You** will immediately see this TUI appear and that is the ``ros-reborn`` tool.

## Boot mode

<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
  **This step** is **extremely important because** choosing the wrong **boot mode** can lead to **serious problems**
  such as being unable to boot into your system,
  corrupted ``GRUB``,
  or **worse**, having to **reinstall RengeOS** using a **USB drive with a Live ISO**.
</Aside>

- **Now** we have two options: ``UEFI`` and ``Legacy BIOS``.

- **Make sure** you know what your boot mode is. If not, check your ``BIOS``. Also, ensure you don't have ``Hybrid Mode`` enabled.

- **Here** I will choose ``UEFI`` because **my machine** is currently using that **boot mode**.

## Select partitions
<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
  **Be careful** with what you choose at this step as it can lead to serious problems such as partition corruption, so please choose correctly!
</Aside>

### EFI(boot) and Root paritions

- **After** selecting the **boot mode**, **the next step** is to choose the partitions in **the following order**:
- **EFI partition (Legacy BIOS is similar) -> Root partition -> Recovery Partition**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ **First**, we need to select the **EFI (boot) partition** and the **root partition**.
+ **Here**, the **EFI (boot) partition** will be ``sda1`` and the **root partition** will be ``sda3``.

|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

### Recovery parition

+ **After** selecting the **two partitions like above**, you will be asked if you want to **choose a partition** for ``Recovery Mode``.

<Aside type="note">
The ``Recovery Mode`` partition will not be formatted and will remain intact. This process is primarily necessary to prevent accidental formatting.
</Aside>

- **Here** I have ``Recovery Mode`` enabled and I will select the ``sda2`` partition as the ``Recovery Mode`` partition.

|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

### Summary

+ **After** we've defined the partitions, we'll review them to ensure everything is correct.

![9](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/9.png)

## Timezone and System locale
- **Now** we need to select the time region, here, I've chosen ``Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh`` because I live there

![10](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/10.png) | ![11](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/11.png)
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

- **After** selecting your region, the next step is to choose your system locale.
- **If** you're unsure what to choose, just select ``English (US)`` as it's the **default** standard on most **other distributions**, and I chose it too.

![12](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/12.png)

## System configuration

- **Now** it will ask you for your computer's hostname, so enter the name you want.

![13](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/13.png)

**After** completing that, the next step is to provide the **user's username**.

<Aside type="caution">
  Remember that you will use it to log in as a user.
</Aside>

![14](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/14.png)

## Configure passwords for Root and User

- **After that**, we will move on to configuring passwords for ``root`` and ``user`` accounts.
+ **And now** we'll begin with setting up the ``root`` password.

![15](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/15.png) | ![16](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/16.png) |
|-----------------|----------------|

- **Once** we've set up the root password, we'll move on to setting up passwords for the ``user`` accounts.

![17](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/17.png) | ![18](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/18.png) |
|-----------------|----------------|

## Kernel selection
- **The next step** is to select the **kernel** that will be installed and used as the **default**.

+ ``linux-renge-bore`` is the latest kernel based on the **Xanmod Kernel** and **BORE Schedule**,
  with **O3 optimization** and **other features** that make laptops/desktops/gaming significantly smoother,
  reducing lag and stutter during heavy background tasks. However, it is not optimized for long-term workloads or servers.
  
+ ``linux-renge-lts`` is also the latest kernel (in terms of official Linux kernel versions for LTS) based on the **Xanmod Kernel**,
  built with **O3 optimization**.
  It excels in smoothness, low latency, and better laptops/desktop/gaming performance than the regular kernel,
  but maintains **long-term** stability and is less optimized than ``linux-renge-bore``.

<Aside type="tip">
 **Choose** ``linux-renge-bore`` if you're unsure which one to choose, as it offers the most comprehensive support (**recommended** by the **author**).
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
**If** you are experiencing a black screen boot issue when booting into **Linux Latest** but not with **Linux LTS**, then select ``linux-renge-lts``.
</Aside>

## Filesystem

<Aside type="note">
  **Currently**, RengeOS only supports bcachefs and xfs, but in the future it will probably support more :) for example, btrfs, f2fs, etc.
</Aside>

- **After** selecting your desired kernel, you will see something like this (for the ``linux-renge-bore`` option).
- **If** we selected ``linux-renge-lts``, only the **xfs filesystem** option will be **displayed** because it doesn't support **bcachefs filesystem**.
- **Anyway**, that's your decision, but I still recommend choosing **bcachefs filesystem** if possible because RengeOS currently has strong support for it.

## Configure Zram (Virtual RAM)

- **After** successfully completing filesystem selection configuration process, the next step is to choose whether or not to enable Zram.

<Aside type="note">
**The following** scenarios may occur:
+ **If** you see that your device has **less than 8GB** of physical RAM, it's recommended to prioritize selecting ``Yes`` as
  it can help prevent RAM overflow later on during crashes,
  building apps from source code, playing demanding games, etc.
+ **If** you already have **too much** RAM or **enough** for your needs without needing more virtual RAM, you can choose ``No``.
</Aside>

## Check before the installation process begins

- **Now** we need to review and confirm whether it has met expectations.
- **If** you're okay with it, you can select **Yes**. Otherwise, select **No**, and you can start the process again.

<Aside type="caution">
  **Note that** selecting Yes will begin the formatting and configuration process according to your choices.
  **Make sure** you have backed up all important data as it will erase everything.
</Aside>

![23](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/23.png) | ![24](../../../assets/example-ros-reborn/24.png) |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

- **The process** will then continue according to the previously configured settings.

![16](../../../assets/example-ros-installer/16.png)

## Wait for the installation process to complete

- **Now** you can make yourself a hot cup of coffee and wait until everything is finished, and you will reach the completion menu.

- **Congratulations! You have successfully restored RengeOS to factory settings with ros-reborn without needing a USB or Live ISO, Yay!!** 🎉 🎉
