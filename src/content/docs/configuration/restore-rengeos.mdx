title: Restore RengeOS (Recovery Mode)
---

- **Essentially**, the ``ros-reborn`` tool allows users to reset their system to its original state
 (as when it was first installed) without having to reinstall using a **Live ISO with a USB drive** as is the usual method.

- **So** we will use ``ros-reborn`` (TUI) to automate the RengeOS restore process to its original state using the ``unsquashfs`` method
and some other related techniques during the process.

## Let's proceed
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="note">
  **Make sure** you have enabled ``Recovery Mode`` during **installation**, and that ``Recovery Mode`` appears in the ``GRUB`` menu.
</Aside>

- **After** booting up your device, at the bottom of the GRUB menu you will see an option called ``Recovery Mode``.
  **Select it** and **boot** into it before proceeding with ``ros-reborn``.
