title: Getting an ISO
---

First, we have two ways to obtain an ISO file.
+ If you want the convenience of saving time on building, you can choose to download the ISO from hosting services.
+ If you want your ISO to always be up-to-date, you can choose to build it from source code.

## Obtain an ISO from hosting services (Any)
import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Google Drive" icon="cloud-download">
    Obtain an ISO here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download</a>
  </Card>
  <Card title="SourceForge" icon="cloud-download">
    Obtain an ISO here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download</a>
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Build it from source code (Arch-based)
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="caution">
  Sometimes, constant updates by the maintainer can make the ISO file unstable.
</Aside>

**Let's get started!**

+ First, you need to git clone this folder to your HOME directory.
```sh
# You can replace ~ with $HOME if you want.
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/RengeOS/Source-ISO && cd ~/Source-ISO/
```
+ Then run the ``build_iso`` script.

```sh
./build_iso
```
+ After the build process is complete, we will have the ISO file located in the ``out`` folder.
