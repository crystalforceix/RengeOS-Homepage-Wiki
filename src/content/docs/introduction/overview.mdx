## What's this?
**RengeOS** is an Arch Linux-based distribution focused on minimalism, performance, stability, high compatibility (supporting both UEFI and Legacy BIOS modes), and high self-maintenance capabilities.

## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Processor** | 1 GHz Dual Core | 2 GHz Dual Core |
| **RAM** | 2 GB | 4 GB |
| **Storage** | 20 GB | 35 GB |

## So what does it have?

+ Although it might be **minimal**, the installation process will be quite easy thanks to ``ros-installer``, which allows direct interaction with the installation process via a TUI (dialog).

+ **It is built on minimalist principles** and contains **no unnecessary components**.
  The integration of a **recovery mode** (optional) ensures easy system repair in case of errors.
  Furthermore, stability is enhanced by <a href="https://bcachefs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bcachefs Filesystem</a>, which supports efficient snapshot creation and management,
  similar to **Btrfs** but with much greater efficiency.

+ It provides an integrated solution to **factory reset** the system and **erase all data** without needing a bootable ISO file or USB drive.
  Simply boot into **Recovery Mode** using ``ros-reborn`` via a TUI (dialog) to restore the system to its **original state** as when it was first installed.
  
+ **The default Linux kernel** is based on the **XanMod Kernel** with several customizations such as a **BORE scheduler** (for the latest kernels except LTS),
  **O3 optimization** (both kernels), **glitched patches from the Frogging Family** (for the latest kernels except LTS)
  and **other patches**, providing powerful system performance :)

+ The compression standard for everything here is the **LZ4 algorithm**
  because it's probably the **fastest algorithm** currently applied by default to the **default built in kernel, zram, mkinitcpio,
  and many others**, delivering quite impressive results in my opinion.

+ By default, **future distros** will always be the base system and will always **support UEFI and Legacy BIOS modes**,
  as well as **bcachefs** in the future, because I want it to be compatible, stable, and lightweight for both older and newer machines up to this point,
  and also to save as many outdated laptops as possible, heheh

## Questions and Answers
 - Q: **Does** it support UEFI and Legacy BIOS modes?
 + A: Yes!

 - Q: **Is it** stable and safe for daily use?
 + A: Basically yes!, but it's not guaranteed yet as it's still under development btw you can try it once:)

 - Q: **Why** did you choose ``bcachefs`` even though it's not yet widely used as a primary filesystem?
 - A: Because I like its filesystem design and it provides good support for ``LZ4 Algorithm`` in background compression and many other things like ``snapshots``, ``hard drive bcache``, ``CoW``, etc.
