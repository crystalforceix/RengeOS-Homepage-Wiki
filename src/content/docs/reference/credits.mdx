- **This distro wouldn't be complete without the examples, tutorials, and valuable contributions from everyone, and I'm so grateful for that!** ❤️

## **The Project Has Been Further Improved Thanks To**

<br />

- [**Xanmod Kernel**](https://xanmod.org/) For their **powerful and flexible kernel**, **which** is the core of **RengeOS!**

- [**micros24**](https://github.com/micros24) For the kernel patches like **Xanmod Kernel with BORE schedules**. **The** performance test results compared to other kernels are quite impressive and are part of ``linux-renge-bore`` and ``linux-renge-lts`` in the **RengeOS** system.

- [**koverstreet**](https://github.com/koverstreet) For his **powerful** ``Bcachefs filesystem``. **I** think it would be great if it were the **default filesystem** in **RengeOS**, btw:)

- [**bathtime**](https://github.com/bathtime) For the
  <a href="https://github.com/bathtime/bcachefs-rollback" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project manages snapshots</a>
  for the ``bcachefs filesystem`` and plays a **crucial role** as an **indispensable feature** in **RengeOS**.

- [**Mai Long**](https://github.com/mailong2401) For the one who discovered the **serious problem** related
  to ``Intel's 10th generation processors`` experiencing black screen issues when using the ``Latest Kernel`` instead of ``LTS Kernel`` and
  as a **key tester**, he has contributed quite a lot.
